Hi, Iâ€™m Ethan. I'm a computer science student from Brisbane.

I'm an avid Machine Learning, AI, Blockchain, and Information/Cyber Security enthusiast.
I spend a lot of my spare time working on reinforcement learning solutions for various topics such as financial market prediction. I also spend a lot of time developing small applications and web apps, along with participating in CTFs on both RingZer0 and W3Challs.
